## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This being my sixth solution I learned to structure my CSS file faster, add the basic reset styles from scratch (and no need to look up on internet :D ).

Also, I'm starting to get use to use "*em*" instead of "*px*" and also thinking more about semantic HTML for accessibility. I'm forcing myself to start on mobile first workflow.


### Continued development

I'd like to improve this by removing some classes and just focus on "main" classes and style them down by HTML elements or start digging a bit more into BEM methodology.
